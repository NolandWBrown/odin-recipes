        <h2>Description</h2>
            A creamy parmigiano cheese sauce you can make yourself!
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>4 tablespoons butter
                ▢4 cloves garlic (finely minced or pressed)
                ▢1 ½ cups heavy cream (divided)
                ▢1 ½ cups parmesan cheese (finely grated)</ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <li>Add butter and garlic to a saute pan and heat over low heat. Allow to cook until the butter is infused with the garlic, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of heavy cream, stir, and allow to come to a simmer. Increase heat to medium, if needed. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and immediately add in parmesan cheese and remaining heavy cream.  (Note: the parmesan will easily melt if it was finely grated from a block. If you used pre-grated cheese that is thicker, you may have to continue heating over low heat to get it to melt.) Stir to combine. It will take several minutes for the cheese to melt. It will look goopy at first and then the sauce will be creamy and smooth. If sauce needs to be thinned, add additional heavy cream.</li>
                <li>To serve, toss with tossed pasta or use to cover vegetables.</li>
