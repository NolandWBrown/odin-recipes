        <h2>Description</h2>
            Our Lasagna Bolognese with Béchamel is absolutely the real deal! One time a very traveled knowledgeable acquaintance said to me ….
            If you have Lasagna Bolognese with Béchamel in your book, I know your book is the real deal!! I said, yes sir!, I do have a recipe for that!! I tried to make mine as authentic as I could from when I first ate it in Spain on the Costa del Sol and then again in Rome. He said I’ll take a book please!!
            I was never so proud or happy!! This recipe is light, soooooo delicious and so full of flavor! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Use the San Marzano Tomatoes when available….makes it so much richer!
            This Lasagna is even more special made with homemade Pasta.
            Also, spoon this sauce over any style of pasta you love! The Sauce or Lasagna freezes so well!!
            Make 2 smaller Lasagnas, eat one and freeze the other!
            Just enjoy this incredible meal that tastes just like you were in Spain or Italy with your family and friends!
